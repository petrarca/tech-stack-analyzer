# .stack-analyzer.yml - Tech Stack Analyzer Configuration
# Place this file in the root of your project to customize the scan behavior
#
# You can also specify a custom config file path to override this default:
#   stack-analyzer scan --config /path/to/custom-config.yml /path/to/project

# Alternatively, you can set ANY configuration via command line using inline JSON:
#   stack-analyzer scan --config '{
#     "properties": {
#       "product-key": "cgm-albis"
#     },
#     "exclude": ["test-dir", "*.log"],
#     "techs": [
#       {"tech": "aws", "reason": "CI/CD"}
#     ]
#   }' /path/to/project

# Custom properties added to metadata.properties in scan output
# Use this to document project context, ownership, or deployment information
#

  product: "My Product Name"
